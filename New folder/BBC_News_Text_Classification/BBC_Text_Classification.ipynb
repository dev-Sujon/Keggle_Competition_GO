No formal offer has been made yet, but Manchester United have confirmed they have received a \\\"detailed proposal\\\" from the US entrepreneur which could lead to a bid. Reports have put the offer at 300p per share, which would value Manchester United at about xc2xa3800m ($1.5bn). The approach by the 76-year-old owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team is reportedly being led by his two sons, Avi and Joel. A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down. However, the BBC has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand.  Mr Glazers previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. That would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed \\\"not... in the best interests of the company\\\" by Manchester Uniteds board when they rejected his approach last year. However, Mr Glazers latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by xc2xa3200m.  While Uniteds board may be casting a serious eye over Mr Glazers latest proposals, supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal.  Supporters group Shareholders United - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to Mr Glazers campaign - said it would fight any move. \\\"Manchester United are a debt-free company. We dont want to fall into debt and we dont need to fall into debt,\\\" Shareholders Uniteds Sean Bones told the BBC. Uniteds players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover. \\\"A lot of people want the clubs interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart,\\\" Rio Ferdinand told BBC Radio Five Live. \\\"No-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table.\\\"  The key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of Uniteds largest shareholders, the Irish horse racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus. Through their Cubic Expression vehicle they own 28.9% of the club. Mr Glazer owns 28.1%. Joe McLean, a football specialist at accountancy firm Grant Thornton, said the support of Mr Magnier and Mr McManus was \\\"utterly crucial\\\". \\\"Mr Glazers bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment. \\\"If thats the case, the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence, maybe 305. \\\"If thats the case then Mr Glazer might well secure their support - if he does, this bid could well go ahead.\\\"  Indeed it is. Malcolm Glazer was little-known in the UK until he started to build up his stake in Manchester United in late 2003. In February 2004 he said he was \\\"considering\\\" whether to bid for the club. No bid emerged, but Mr Glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. In October 2004, Manchester United said they had received a \\\"preliminary approach\\\", which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer. However, the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve. At the clubs annual general meeting in November, Mr Glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board. Legal adviser Maurice Watkins, commercial director Andy Anson and non-executive director Philip Yea were voted out, against the wishes of chief executive David Gill. But the move led to bankers JP Morgan and public relations firm Brunswick withdrawing from the Glazer bid team. \",\n          \"Liverpool pledge to keep Gerrard  Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry insists the club will never sell Steven Gerrard amid reports Chelsea will renew their bid to lure him from Anfield.  Gerrard reiterated his desire to win trophies with the Reds after his superb Champions League winner on Wednesday. And Parry has moved to scotch claims that Chelsea could launch a xc2xa335m bid. \\\"There is no chance of Stevie going in January,\\\" said Parry. \\\"That just wont happen. Our intention is that we will never let him go.\\\" Gerrard scored a spectacular late goal to give Liverpool a 3-1 win over Olympiakos and book their place in the knockout stages. \\\"Of course he is ambitious but so are we,\\\" Parry added. \\\"We firmly believe that if we can satisfy his ambition he will remain a Liverpool player. \\\"We have an open and straightforward relationship. We both know where we stand and that played a big part in his decision to stay last summer. If he was not so committed to Liverpool he would have gone by now.\\\" Gerrard had said before Wednesdays game he would consider leaving if the club was knocked out of Europe, with Real Madrid also believed to be monitoring his situation.  \\\"The main point I have made is I want to be in a Liverpool side which challenges for the Champions League and the title all the time,\\\" he said afterwards. \\\"I want to be winning things with Liverpool, not somewhere else. \\\"I am a fan as well and I think what I have said the supporters will agree with. \\\"We have to build on wins like that, not just settle for a great win and then not progress any further. \\\"My goal was one of the most important I have ever scored and I hope it turns out to be one of the most important for the club for a long time. \\\"I know I put a lot of pressure on myself because of what I said, and I felt I needed a big performance, but I am not going to go around telling lies about how I feel.\\\"  Reds manager Rafael Benitez believes Gerrard can win everything he wants to without moving clubs. \\\"Steven can win all he wants with us and we need him. He has seen that we have a good team and we can do more things in the future,\\\" said Benitez. \\\"But if we want to win more games, important games, we need Steven in the team. \\\"We need his strength, the strong mentality he has and his quality. I think he likes and wants the responsibility of leading this team.\\\" \",\n          \"Dallaglio his own man to the end  Controversy and Lawrence Dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career.  Even the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue, just four days before the start of the season. But then Dallaglio has always been his own man. Ever since emerging onto the international scene Dallaglio has polarised opinions. To supporters of England, Dallaglio could do no wrong. An integral part of a sustained period of success for England, Dallaglios crowning glory was his part in the side that won the Rugby World Cup in 2003.  Rival fans, meanwhile, have tended to take an alternative view, seeing Dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of English rugby. Never afraid to speak his mind, be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch, or his coach or the media off it, Dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way. Dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded England side which became the shock winners of the first Rugby Sevens World Cup in 1993. It took him another two years to graduate to the full England XV, but once there he proved to the manor born. Displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years, Dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard.  Within two years of his debut, Dallaglio was offered the England captains band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 Lions tour to South Africa. Although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of England team-mate Martin Johnson, he played a massive role in the 2-1 series victory. But after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum, Dallaglios career hit the buffers at speed in 1999.  First came the last-minute defeat to Wales in which Dallaglios decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing England a Grand Slam. Worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured England captaincy. With sensational allegations of drug use - of which he was subsequently cleared - splashed across the front pages, a devastated Dallaglio stepped down as England skipper. But he bounced back, getting his head down at club level before returning to the England fold, albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain Johnson. As a member of a new-look England side on the long road to World Cup glory - a journey not without mishaps as a succession of Grand Slams opportunities were spurned - Dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again.  Yet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short Dallaglios involvement on the Lions tour to Australia.  Rumours began to circulate that his career was over but, in typical Dallaglio style, he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen. One effect of the injury was to rob Dallaglio of much of his pace, but ever the pragmatist, he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre.  The only player to play every minute of Englands World Cup triumph in Australia, Dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure Englands historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by England supporters. Following Johnsons retirement, Dallaglios career came full circle as Woodward restored him as England captain. While England did not hit the heights in Dallaglios second spell as captain, losing five of their eight post-World Cup Tests, Dallaglio led by example, leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many World Cup stars to live up to expectations. Dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of Englands most accomplished players, if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country.  The problem now for England is how to replace the almost irreplaceable. The likes of Matt Dawson, Jonny Wilkinson, Phil Vickery and Hill have all been mentioned as contenders for Dallaglios role as captain. But it is as a player that England will really struggle to replace the 32-year-old. Although players like Joe Worsley and Chris Jones are more than capable of stepping up, the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about Dallaglios massive influence on English rugby. \\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

The lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall TFC 101 Tower in Taipei, Taiwan. The Guinness Book of Records has declared the 17m per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on Earth. The lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed.  In total, the TFC Tower has 61 lifts, 34 of them double-deckers, and 50 escalators to shuttle people around its 106 floors. The TFC 101 Tower is due to be officially opened on 31 December.  The super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds, while ascending their 382m track. The 17m/s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph (61km/h). Curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the TFC Tower. The key new technologies applied in the worlds fastest elevators include:    - A pressure control system, which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers, preventing \\\"ear popping\\\"   - An active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations   - Streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft     \\\"The certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative Guinness World Records is a great honour for us,\\\" said Masayuki Shimono, president of manufacturer Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems which installed the lifts. The first record for the worlds fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the Guinness Book of Records in 1955. \\\"As such, it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition, when the record was 426m per minute, or 25.6 km/h, less than half the speed of the new record,\\\" said Hein Le Roux, specialist researcher at the Guinness World Records. Taipeis TFC 101 Tower is more than 50m taller than the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia - formerly the worlds tallest skyscraper. \",\n          \"Hacker threat to Apples iTunes  Users of Apples music jukebox iTunes need to update the software to avoid a potential security threat.  Hackers can build malicious playlist files which could crash the program and let them seize control of the computer by inserting Trojan code. A new version of iTunes is now available from the Apple website which solves the problem. Security firm iDefence, which notified users of the problem, recommended that users upgrade to iTunes version 4.7.1. The problem affects all users of iTunes - Windows and Mac OS - running versions 4.7 and earlier. Users can automatically upgrade iTunes by opening the \\\"look for updates\\\" window in the program. The security firm says users should avoid clicking on or accessing playlist files - which have the file extension of .pls or .m3u - which have come from unknown sources. Itunes is the worlds most popular online music store with more than 200 million songs downloaded since it launched in 2003. \",\n          \"Nintendo adds media playing to DS  Nintendo is releasing an adapter for its DS handheld console so it can play music and video.  The add-on for the DS means people can download TV programmes, film clips or MP3 files to the adaptor and then play them back while on the move. The release of the media add-on is an attempt by the Japanese games giant to protect its dominance of the handheld gaming market. Nintendo said the media adapter will be available from February in Japan.  The Nintendo DS is the successor to the hugely successful GameBoy handheld game console and went on sale in Japan on 2 December. The DS has two screens, one of which is touch sensitive, and also has on-board a short-range wireless link that lets people play against each other.  The launch of the media adapter, and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device, is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the Sony PSP which was built as a multi-purpose media player and game gadget from the start. Sony is thought to be preparing pre-packaged movies and music for the PSP. The add-on will also work with the GameBoy Advance SP. Nintendo dominates the handheld gaming console world thanks to successive versions of the GameBoy. More than 28 million GameBoy Advance handhelds have been sold around the world. The dual-screen DS is also thought to be selling well with more than 2.5 million expected to be sold by the end of 2004. Nintendo said it had no plans to sell the media adapter outside Japan. When it goes on sale the adapter is expected to cost about 5000 yen (xc2xa325), roughly the difference in price between the DS and the higher-priced Sony PSP. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":34}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.head(5)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"5xzaLktjBMl7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750938126530,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":72,"user":{"displayName":"myLinux Desktop","userId":"02819822116962449497"}},"outputId":"b71393f2-92a0-4268-b77d-17ecfdb5c681"},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                data         labels\n","0  Musicians to tackle US red tape  Musicians gro...  entertainment\n","1  U2s desire to be number one  U2, who have won ...  entertainment\n","2  Rocker Doherty in on-stage fight  Rock singer ...  entertainment\n","3  Snicket tops US box office chart  The film ada...  entertainment\n","4  Oceans Twelve raids box office  Oceans Twelve,...  entertainment"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-45b60a25-ffc3-4582-a91b-9782a7bd5d5d\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>data</th>\n","      <th>labels</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Musicians to tackle US red tape  Musicians gro...</td>\n","      <td>entertainment</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>U2s desire to be number one  U2, who have won ...</td>\n","      <td>entertainment</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Rocker Doherty in on-stage fight  Rock singer ...</td>\n","      <td>entertainment</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Snicket tops US box office chart  The film ada...</td>\n","      <td>entertainment</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Oceans Twelve raids box office  Oceans Twelve,...</td>\n","      <td>entertainment</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-45b60a25-ffc3-4582-a91b-9782a7bd5d5d')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-45b60a25-ffc3-4582-a91b-9782a7bd5d5d button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

Lawyers for news organisations said it was \\\"really vital\\\" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public \\\"to serve as a check on the process\\\". Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (xc2xa32.13m).  Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is \\\"100% certain\\\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.  \\\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\\\" a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (xc2xa31.33m) to $4m (xc2xa32.13m) of local taxpayers money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (xc2xa321,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.  Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. \\\"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves children. You dont molest anything that you love.\\\" Describing Mr Jackson as \\\"a good person\\\", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial. \\\"I cant sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\\\" she said. \",\n          \"Game firm holds cast auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.  The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for \\\"a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters\\\". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performers fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.  \\\"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,\\\" said Shauna Perry, Biowares audio and external resources producer. \\\"Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.\\\" She added: \\\"Not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games.\\\" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \\\"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - its really quite incredible how detailed they are,\\\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \\\"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \\\"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\\\" \",\n          \"Citizenship event for 18s touted  Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.  The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches \\\"inclusive citizenship\\\" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \\\"other cultural identities\\\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.  The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bells comments were \\\"highly irresponsible\\\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \\\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\\\" said a Home Office spokesman. \\\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\\\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.  \\\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\\\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \\\"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \\\"This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\\\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.  The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

Lawyers for news organisations said it was \\\"really vital\\\" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public \\\"to serve as a check on the process\\\". Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (xc2xa32.13m).  Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is \\\"100% certain\\\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.  \\\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\\\" a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (xc2xa31.33m) to $4m (xc2xa32.13m) of local taxpayers money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (xc2xa321,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.  Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. \\\"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves children. You dont molest anything that you love.\\\" Describing Mr Jackson as \\\"a good person\\\", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial. \\\"I cant sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\\\" she said. \",\n          \"Game firm holds cast auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.  The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for \\\"a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters\\\". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performers fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.  \\\"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,\\\" said Shauna Perry, Biowares audio and external resources producer. \\\"Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.\\\" She added: \\\"Not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games.\\\" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \\\"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - its really quite incredible how detailed they are,\\\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \\\"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \\\"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\\\" \",\n          \"Citizenship event for 18s touted  Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.  The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches \\\"inclusive citizenship\\\" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \\\"other cultural identities\\\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.  The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bells comments were \\\"highly irresponsible\\\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \\\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\\\" said a Home Office spokesman. \\\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\\\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.  \\\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\\\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \\\"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \\\"This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\\\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.  The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":51}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import nltk\n","nltk.download('wordnet')\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","\n","# Initialize Lemmatizer and Stopwords\n","lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n","stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n","\n","def clean_text(text):\n","    # Remove HTML tags\n","    text = re.sub(r'<.*?>', '', text)\n","    # Remove emojis (basic regex, might not catch all)\n","    text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s#@/:%.\\-]+', '', text, flags=re.UNICODE)\n","    # Remove special characters and punctuation\n","    text = re.sub(r'[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation), '', text)\n","    # Convert to lowercase\n","    text = text.lower()\n","    # Remove extra whitespace\n","    text = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text).strip()\n","    return text\n","\n","def preprocess_text(text):\n","    # Apply cleaning\n","    text = clean_text(text)\n","    # Tokenize (split into words)\n","    tokens = text.split()\n","    # Remove stopwords and lemmatize\n","    processed_tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens if word not in stop_words]\n","    # Join tokens back into a string\n","    return ' '.join(processed_tokens)\n","\n","# Apply the preprocessing function to the 'text' column\n","df['cleaned_text'] = df['data'].apply(preprocess_text)\n","\n","# Display the first few rows with the new cleaned_text column\n","print(df[['data', 'cleaned_text']].head())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2mn1nX8cB66w","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750938803174,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":2186,"user":{"displayName":"myLinux Desktop","userId":"02819822116962449497"}},"outputId":"3fd51863-ae21-4fba-dd0b-f160ab8a603b"},"execution_count":53,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package wordnet is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["                                                data  \\\n","0  Musicians to tackle US red tape  Musicians gro...   \n","1  U2s desire to be number one  U2, who have won ...   \n","2  Rocker Doherty in on-stage fight  Rock singer ...   \n","3  Snicket tops US box office chart  The film ada...   \n","4  Oceans Twelve raids box office  Oceans Twelve,...   \n","\n","                                        cleaned_text  \n","0  musician tackle u red tape musician group tack...  \n","1  u2s desire number one u2 three prestigious gra...  \n","2  rocker doherty onstage fight rock singer pete ...  \n","3  snicket top u box office chart film adaptation...  \n","4  ocean twelve raid box office ocean twelve crim...  \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.sample(10)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":363},"id":"EpUzDkkeEqSt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750938810584,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":36,"user":{"displayName":"myLinux Desktop","userId":"02819822116962449497"}},"outputId":"8f045964-ea07-4b24-80f6-b0c14b67fb79"},"execution_count":54,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                   data         labels  \\\n","1129  Jones doping probe begins  An investigation in...          sport   \n","1713  Civil servants in strike ballot  The UKs bigge...       politics   \n","264   Halloween writer Debra Hill dies  Screenwriter...  entertainment   \n","1621  Profile: David Miliband  David Milibands rapid...       politics   \n","518   US consumer confidence up  Consumers confidenc...       business   \n","1669  Analysis: No pain, no gain?

But Wright-Phillips will not make his first start for England playing on the left, as had been widely expected. \\\"Shaun Wright-Phillips will probably start the game,\\\" said Eriksson. \\\"But Im not going to start Wright-Phillips on the left.\\\" Eriksson also revealed that Wes Brown will start alongside Jamie Carragher in the injury-hit centre of defence. When asked if Brown and Carragher would start Eriksson replied: \\\"I could tell you yes. \\\"Its a blow that four or five central defenders are away because of injuries. \\\"On the other hand its good for Carragher and Brown to show what they can do at this level. Thats positive.\\\" The England coach said that he had been impressed by Wright-Phillips form for Manchester City. \\\"He deserves his chance. He has been playing well all season and I look forward to seeing him.\\\" And he added that Andy Johnson and Stewart Downing - the other two new players in the squad - would also get a chance to impress. \\\"Wright-Phillips, Downing and Johnson will start or get the chance to play some part. \\\"Johnson was not in my plans a year ago but he is doing a great season and scoring a lot of goals. \\\"Downing is another one making a great season. He is young, talented and there are not too many left-footed players in the squad.\\\" \",\n          \"Civil servants in strike ballot  The UKs biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.  The Public and Commercial Services Union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions. Unions have already earmarked 23 March for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million UK workers. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.  PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.  \\\"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isnt it ironic that theyre saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\\\" he said. \\\"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \\\"In the 20th century, its completely unacceptable.\\\" BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented \\\"a formidable force\\\" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election. A stoppage involving civil servants, in particular, could seriously disrupt or close government departments, agencies and museums, he said.  Opposition to raising the retirement age is \\\"one thing all the unions are agreed on\\\", our correspondent added. Unisons 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers Unions 70,000 and Amicus 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on Thursday night. Our correspondent said that he understood no deal had been offered in that meeting but that there was room for further negotiations. There was \\\"some possibility\\\" of the strike action being avoided, he added. \",\n          \"Analysis: No pain, no gain?  He called it his \\\"masochism strategy\\\" in the run-up to the Iraq war and now Tony Blair has signed up for another dose of pain.  The idea is simple - the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of \\\"real\\\" voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras. The theory is that talking to the great British public, even if they are the \\\"great unwashed\\\", is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians. It is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real peoples concerns and - on occasions - of their outright fury. Mr Blair used the tactic before the Iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run-up to the election.  Labour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin, \\\"control freakery\\\" and over-slick presentation - sometimes from within the ranks of its own MPs. Tony Blair himself has said people complain he does not listen. Mr Blairs latest bout of flagellation came with a series of questions sessions on Five television throughout Wednesday.  The trouble began on the Wright Stuff show, with Maria Hutchings marching up to him, saying \\\"Tony, thats rubbish\\\" as she tried to complain about her autistic sons school being threatened with closure. A few \\\"dont worries\\\" as Mrs Hutchings was led back to the audience averted a public slanging match - he spoke to her privately after the show. But that was only the start and later sessions produced the type of grilling not even the toughest television interviewer could produce.  Writer Neil Coppendale, from West Sussex, asked of the Iraq war: \\\"Tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children died - how do you manage to sleep at night?\\\" On immigration, London teacher Diane Granger said: \\\"Where are you going to put everyone?\\\" And can you imagine even Jeremy Paxman putting the question posed by Brighton nurse Marion Brown: \\\"Would you wipe somebodys backside for xc2xa35?\\\"  Mr Blair tried to use the questioners first names - and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems. Many of the newspapers have branded the exercise a PR stunt which backfired. Indeed there is a danger Mr Blair simply ends up looking \\\"embattled\\\". Conservative Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat Charles Kennedy are to be offered chances to appear in similar slots on the channel next month. Labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become a story and the real issues take prominence.  James Humphreys, ex-head of corporate communications at Number 10, says the strategy shows frustration with the media. \\\"They feel they dont get their voice across and going direct to people is clearly their game on this occasion,\\\" he says. There are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls, he argues. The prime minister knows full well the potential hazards .  He must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with Sharron Storer, the Birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the 2001 election campaign. \\\"All you do is walk around and make yourself known, you dont do anything to help anybody,\\\" she told Mr Blair before stomping off, refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately. Former Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell has described the episode as a \\\"bit of a disaster\\\" as it meant the launch of Labours election manifesto received little coverage. But it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive, not least because it coincided with John Prescotts even more direct contact - when he punched an egg-throwing protester.  Former prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public. The undoubted highlight of years of election phone-in shows was Margaret Thatcher discomfort on Nationwide in 1983, when viewer Diana Gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the Belgrano in the Falklands War. John Major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the 1992 election campaign with his famous soapbox.  It may have left him splattered with eggs and engine oil at times but he felt it added \\\"fizz\\\" to his campaign. In his memoirs, he also argues the strategy contrasted with Neil Kinnocks \\\"contrived photo opportunities\\\" and attempts at an artful campaign. \\\"He wanted to look like a prime minister. I  was  prime minister and I wanted a flesh and blood fight,\\\" says Mr Major. Mr Blair told prospective Labour MPs on Thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could \\\"enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment\\\". But he also wants to counter complaints that he has spent too much time on international affairs and foreign trips. Mr Blair recalls how Bill Clinton once advised him: \\\"Always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day.\\\" His hope must be that voters watching him on the rack will bear out for Labour the old maxim: \\\"No pain, no gain.\\\" \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Rates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.  Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britains retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.  \\\"Todays no change decision is correct,\\\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \\\"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \\\"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\\\"  Mr Frost added: \\\"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \\\"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\\\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \\\"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\\\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \\\"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\\\" he said. \\\"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\\\"  On Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.  \\\"So far the evidence suggests that last years rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\\\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \\\"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\\\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen. \",\n          \"Crucial decision on super-casinos  A decision on whether to allow Westminster to legislate on super-casinos is set to be made by the Scottish Parliament.  The government has plans for up to eight Las Vegas style resorts in the UK, one of which is likely to be in Glasgow. Scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a super-casino will be built in Scotland. But opposition parties say that will not happen in practice. The vote is due to be taken on Wednesday and is expected to be close.  The Scottish Executive believes that the legislation should be handled by Westminster. The new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved. A super-casino in Glasgow could be located at Ibrox or the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. The new gambling bill going through Westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public, have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes. But the Scottish National Party and the Tories say the issue of super-casinos should be decided in Scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility. \",\n          \"Foxx and Swank take actors awards  Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank have won the Screen Actors Guild Awards for best male and female film actors, boosting their Oscars hopes this month.  Foxxs portrayal of late soul-singer Ray Charles in Ray had already earned him a prestigious Golden Globe award. Swank triumphed for playing a gutsy female boxer in Million Dollar Baby. Modest wine country comedy Sideways knocked out favourites Million Dollar Baby and The Aviator by taking the top prize for best cast performance.  The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) represents US film and TV actors. Its winners often go on to win Oscars. In other nominations, Cate Blanchett triumphed as the best supporting actress for her role as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator. Veteran actor Morgan Freeman took the best supporting actor award for playing a prize-fighter turned gym manager in Million Dollar Baby.  \\\"Thank you for Ray Charles for just living so complex and so interesting, and making us all just come together,\\\" said Foxx, accepting his award in Los Angeles on Saturday.  He also praised the film director: \\\"Thank you for Taylor Hackford for taking a chance with an African-American film. Taylor, youre my director of the year.\\\" Swank, too, was full of praise for her director and co-star Clint Eastwood. \\\"I bow down to you,\\\" Swank said to the 74-year-old Eastwood. \\\"You are a talent beyond compare. If Im half the person you are and half the talent you are when Im 74, I will know that Ive accomplished something great.\\\"  Both Foxx and Swank are now considered to be among the favourites to get Oscars - the Hollywoods ultimate prize. However, Swank has to overcome a strong challenge from Annette Bening, a nominee for the theatre farce Being Julia. Meanwhile, ballots for Oscars - the Hollywoods top honours - were mailed earlier this week to members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The voting is due to end on 22 February - five days before the ceremony. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
